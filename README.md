**Project 1: Regional Accent Classification** 
This Pytorch project focuses on the automatic classification of five regional African American English (AAE) accents using an XGBoost classifier. We've leveraged acoustic features including Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), Linear Prediction Coding (LPC), and Power Normalized Cepstral Coefficients (PNCC) to ensure robust performance on both clean and noisy audio data.
